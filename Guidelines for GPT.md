When writing Blog Posts keep these following guidelines in mind.
## Content
- For each content piece, you’re going to get an outline. Follow the outline to the T.
- For each paragraph, use 1-4 lines max. Don’t overdo it with either end. We don’t want the entire article to be composed of single sentences, and at the same time, it shouldn’t be blocky paragraphs either.
- Unless specified otherwise, maintain a conversational tone. The reader is a friend you’re talking to in real life. Write accordingly
- Make the style personal. Refer to the reader as “You.” Mention stories, examples, pop culture references or jokes when appropriate
- Use personal anecdotes only when appropriate. 90% of the cases, you’re going to be writing under the client’s name, so the writing should reflect that
- Use active voice instead of passive
- The article should be very easy to read - just about anyone reading it should be able to follow. So, avoid overly complex words and sentences
- Keep in mind your target audience, and tailor your style accordingly.
  - For example, you wouldn’t make Rick and Morty references if your audience is a middle-aged accountant. You WOULD make Rick and Morty references if you’re writing for 20-30-year-old hipster designers, potheads, ITs, and so on.
  - Keep in mind what your readers already know. For example, let’s say you’re writing about “how to make a resume.” You can safely assume your readers don’t know anything on the topic, and you need to explain everything from 0 to 100.
  - On the other hand, let’s say you’re writing about something more complex. Say, “business process management software”. Chances are, your readers are savvy businessmen. You shouldn’t start from the very basics like “A business process is…”
- Use Bold to drive the point home
- Keep a good flow
- Drive the point home. Whenever you make a statement, back it up. E.g. if you’re saying, “you should include a resume summary in your CV,” you need to follow up by saying why you should do that “(because it helps catch the recruiter’s attention from a single glance at your resume”).
## SEO
- ALL content that you write should be optimized for Google
- Get the Keyword density right. For each article, you’ll get a “keyword.” The keyword should make up 0.5% - 2% of the article word count.
- The keyword must be mentioned in:
  - the meta description
  - the title
  - some H2 headings
- Page title: between 40 to 65 characters
- URL slug: brief and contains the keyword
- Meta description: Between 148-156 characters
- Use Headers/Sub-headers: H2, H3, and (rarely) H4 to properly structure your content. DON’T use H1. That’s reserved for the title.
  - Make sure each sub-header answers a specific search query
- Sub-header sections: Less than 300 words each
